This software is for creating audio recorder appliances on Linux.  The main
use case is concert recording with a small SBC such as a
RaspberryPi or BeagleBone.  It is controlled with an HTML/JS interface.

The core consists of a Python Tornado server with a C++ module that interfaces with ALSA and writes the FLAC files.  TornadIO2/Socket.IO is used for realtime communication with the controlling browser.  Components are tied together with ZeroMQ.

features:

 * reliable, direct to FLAC recording
 * generous pre-roll buffer
 * gapless stop and re-record
 * HTML/Javascript interface that works on iOS or Android
 * good level meters with peak hold
