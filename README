This software provides a web interface to an audio recorder.  The main
use case is concert recording on a portable Linux SBC such as a
RaspberryPi or BeagleBone and controlled by the users phone over wifi.

In addition to a double-buffered direct to FLAC recorder tuned for
low power embedded processors and a web interface, the package
includes Chef recipes for setting up and testing the complete system.
